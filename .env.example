# Environment Variables for GitHub OAuth

# Create a GitHub OAuth App:
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/developers
# 2. Click "New OAuth App"
# 3. Fill in:
#    - Application name: CodeReview AI (Dev)
#    - Homepage URL: http://localhost:5173
#    - Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
# 4. Click "Register application"
# 5. Copy the Client ID and generate a Client Secret
# 6. Paste them below:

VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id_here
VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret_here

# For production, you'll also need a backend to handle the OAuth token exchange
# This is because the client secret should never be exposed in frontend code
